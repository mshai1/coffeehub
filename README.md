# CoffeeHub

Welcome to CoffeeHub! This project is a solo endeavor aimed at gaining experience with React and Bootstrap. CoffeeHub has been designed not only to serve as a platform for honing my React and Bootstrap skills but also to serve a greater purpose. It's an initiative aimed at aiding future software engineers in understanding accessibility principles. By developing CoffeeHub, I aimed to showcase my independent learning journey while contributing to a team goal of educating software engineering students about designing for accessibility, particularly for screen readers. The idea of integrating sound feedback within CoffeeHub stands as an excellent example of this commitment to accessibility.

## Overview

CoffeeHub is a React-based web application designed to simulate a coffee-making experience. It currently consists of three main web pages:

1. **Home**: The landing page of the application.
2. **OfferedCoffee**: Displays the types of coffee offered.
3. **MakeCoffee**: Allows users to make coffee.

## Functionality

In the **MakeCoffee** page, users can interact with a virtual coffee-making machine. The machine starts with default quantities of coffee, milk, and water. When a user makes a coffee, these quantities decrease accordingly, and the user earns money. However, after a certain number of coffees, the stock runs out, requiring the user to reset the machine. Clicking the reset button restores the default quantities of milk, coffee, and water, along with resetting the earned money.

## Technologies Used

- React: The project is built using the React library, enabling dynamic and efficient user interfaces.
- Bootstrap: Bootstrap is utilized for the design and layout of the web pages, providing a responsive and visually appealing experience.

## Project Status

This project is currently a work in progress. Future updates may include additional features, improvements to existing functionality, and enhancements to the user interface.
